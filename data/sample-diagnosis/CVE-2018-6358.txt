In listfdb, Missing Code to Verify Quantity [nGlyphs] in Codebase listfdb.c:397 results in a Inconsistent Value of (8) bytes. Subsequently, the Wrong Size (8) derived from [nGlyphs] was used to perform a Sequential Reposition of pointer [offset] in Codebase listfdb.c:404, which resulted in an Over Bounds Pointer. Finally, using the Over Bounds Pointer [offset] to perform a Sequential Write of Moderate data [8] bytes to Heap object of size 4 in Codebase listfdb.c:404 results in a final Buffer Overflow Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to data tampering or remote code execution and denial of service - application crash.
