In jasper, Missing Code to Verify Quantity [tccp->maxrlvls] in Codebase jpc_enc.c:620 results in a Inconsistent Value of (728) bytes. Subsequently, the Wrong Size (728) derived from [tccp->maxrlvls] was used to perform a Sequential Reposition of pointer [tccp] in Codebase jpc_enc.c:622, which resulted in an Over Bounds Pointer. Finally, using the Over Bounds Pointer [tccp] to perform a Sequential Write of Moderate data [728] bytes to Heap object of size 720 in Codebase jpc_enc.c:622 results in a final Buffer Overflow Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to data tampering or remote code execution and denial of service - application crash.
