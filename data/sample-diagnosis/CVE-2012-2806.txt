In djpeg, Missing Code to Verify Quantity [cinfo->num_components] in Codebase jdmarker.c:326 results in a Inconsistent Value. Subsequently, the Wrong Size derived from [cinfo->num_components] was used to perform a Sequential Reposition of pointer [cinfo->cur_comp_info] in Codebase jdmarker.c:327, which resulted in an Over Bounds Pointer. Finally, using the Over Bounds Pointer [cinfo->cur_comp_info] to perform a Sequential Write of Little data [0] bytes to Stack object of size None in Codebase jdmarker.c:327 results in a final Buffer Overflow Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to data tampering or remote code execution and denial of service - application crash.
