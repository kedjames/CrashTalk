In imginfo, Erroneous Code (if (!(crg->comps = jas_malloc(cstate->numcomps * sizeof(uint_fast16_t)))) {) to Calculate the size of a buffer at jpc_cs.c:1349 leads to allocation of not enough memory,allowing a pointer (val) to reposition over its bounds at (jpc_cs.c:1562), which, when used in (*val = v;) at line (jpc_cs.c:1562) leads to a heap buffer overflow. If exploited, this can lead to data tampering or code execution and denial of service - application crash.
