In strings, Missing Code to Verify Quantity [len] in Codebase tekhex.c:336 results in a Inconsistent Value. Subsequently, the Wrong Size (0) derived from [len] was used to perform a Sequential Reposition of pointer [dstp] in Codebase tekhex.c:337, which resulted in an Over Bounds Pointer. Finally, using the Over Bounds Pointer [dstp] to perform a Sequential Write of Moderate data to the Stack in Codebase tekhex.c:337 results in a final Buffer Overflow Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to data tampering or remote code execution and denial of service - application crash.
