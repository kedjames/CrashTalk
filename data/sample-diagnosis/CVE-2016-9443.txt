In w3m, missing code for an initialize pointer operation of pointer (item->value) to valid memory at (form.c:108) leads to a NULL Pointer. The NULL Pointer (form->value->ptr) was dereferenced via a direct Read operation at (form.c:462), which resulted in a NULL Pointer Dereference Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to denial of service - application crash.
