In cjpeg-static, Missing Code to Verify Quantity [t] in Codebase rdbmp.c:208 results in a Inconsistent Value of (129) bytes. Subsequently, the Wrong Index (129) derived from [t] was used to perform a Direct Reposition of pointer [colormap] in Codebase rdbmp.c:211, which resulted in an Over Bounds Pointer. Finally, using the Over Bounds Pointer [colormap] to perform a Direct Read of Moderate data [129] bytes from Heap object of size 119 in Codebase rdbmp.c:211 results in a final Buffer Overflow Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to information exposure.
