In readelf, Erroneous Code (return xmalloc (nmemb * size);) to Calculate the size of a buffer at dwarf.c:9576 leads to allocation of not enough memory,allowing a pointer (option->size) to reposition over its bounds at (readelf.c:16204), which, when used in (option->size = BYTE_GET (eoption->size);) at line (readelf.c:16204) leads to a heap buffer overflow. If exploited, this can lead to data tampering or code execution and denial of service - application crash.
