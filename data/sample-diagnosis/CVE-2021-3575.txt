In opj_decompress, Missing Code to Verify Quantity in Codebase color.c:336 results in a Inconsistent Value of (292) bytes. Subsequently, the Wrong Value (292) was used to perform a Direct Reposition of pointer [cr] in Codebase color.c:379, which resulted in an Over Bounds Pointer. Finally, using the Over Bounds Pointer [cr] to perform a Direct Read of Moderate data [292] bytes from Heap object of size 288 in Codebase color.c:379 results in a final Buffer Overflow Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to information exposure.
