In potrace, Erroneous Code (bm->map = (potrace_word *) malloc(dy * h * BM_WORDSIZE);) to Calculate the size of a buffer at bitmap.h:66 leads to allocation of not enough memory,allowing a pointer (bm) to reposition over its bounds at (bitmap_io.c:615), which, when used in (BM_UPUT(bm, x, ycorr(y), c > 3 * threshold * 255 ? 0 : 1);) at line (bitmap_io.c:615) leads to a heap buffer overflow. If exploited, this can lead to information exposure, data corruption and denial of service - application crash.
