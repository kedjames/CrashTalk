In nasm, missing code for an initialize pointer operation of pointer (label) to valid memory at (parser.c:451) leads to a NULL Pointer. The NULL Pointer (eop) was dereferenced via a direct Read operation at (labels.c:64), which resulted in a NULL Pointer Dereference Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to denial of service - application crash.
