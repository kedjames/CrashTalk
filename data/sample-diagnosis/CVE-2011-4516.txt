In imginfo, Missing Code to Verify Quantity [compparms->numrlvls] in Codebase jpc_dec.c:1665 results in a Inconsistent Value of (897) bytes. Subsequently, the Wrong Size (897) derived from [compparms->numrlvls] was used to perform a Sequential Reposition of pointer [ccp->prcheightexpns] in Codebase jpc_dec.c:1667, which resulted in an Over Bounds Pointer. Finally, using the Over Bounds Pointer [ccp->prcheightexpns] to perform a Sequential Write of Moderate data [897] bytes to Heap object of size 896 in Codebase jpc_dec.c:1667 results in a final Buffer Overflow Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to data tampering or remote code execution and denial of service - application crash.
