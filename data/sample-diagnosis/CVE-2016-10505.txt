In opj_decompress, missing code for an initialize pointer operation of pointer (data) to valid memory at (image.c:185) leads to a NULL Pointer. The NULL Pointer (cr) was dereferenced via a direct Read operation at (color.c:115), which resulted in a NULL Pointer Dereference Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to denial of service - application crash.
