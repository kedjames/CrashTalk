In nasm, Missing Code to Verify Quantity [arg] in Codebase preproc.c:4070 results in a Inconsistent Value. Subsequently, the Wrong Size derived from [arg] was used to perform a Sequential Reposition of pointer [buff] in Codebase preproc.c:4070, which resulted in an Over Bounds Pointer. Finally, using the Over Bounds Pointer [buff] to perform a Sequential Write of Moderate data to Stack object in Codebase preproc.c:4070 results in a final Buffer Overflow Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to data tampering or remote code execution and denial of service - application crash.
