In w3m, missing code for an initialize pointer operation of pointer (tbl_mode) to valid memory at (file.c:6287) leads to a NULL Pointer. The NULL Pointer (tbl_mode) was dereferenced via a direct Read operation at (file.c:6320), which resulted in a NULL Pointer Dereference Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to denial of service - application crash.
