In djpeg, missing code for an initialize pointer operation of pointer (output_buf) to valid memory at (jdapistd.c:316) leads to a NULL Pointer. The NULL Pointer (output_buf) was dereferenced via a direct Read operation at (jquant1.c:536), which resulted in a NULL Pointer Dereference Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to denial of service - application crash.
