In opj_compress, missing code for an initialize pointer operation of pointer (s) to valid memory at (convert.c:1348) leads to a NULL Pointer. The NULL Pointer (s) was dereferenced via a direct Read operation at (convert.c:1331), which resulted in a NULL Pointer Dereference Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to denial of service - application crash.
