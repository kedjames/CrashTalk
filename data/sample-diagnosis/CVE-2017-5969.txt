In xmllint, missing code for an initialize pointer operation of pointer (N) to valid memory at (xmlIO.c:2520) leads to a NULL Pointer. The NULL Pointer (N) was dereferenced via a direct Read operation at (valid.c:1181), which resulted in a NULL Pointer Dereference Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to denial of service - application crash.
