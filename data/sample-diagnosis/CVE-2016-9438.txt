In w3m, missing code for an initialize pointer operation of pointer (buf->input_alt.value) to valid memory at (file.c:6927) leads to a NULL Pointer. The NULL Pointer (obuf->input_alt.value->ptr) was dereferenced via a direct Read operation at (file.c:3025), which resulted in a NULL Pointer Dereference Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to denial of service - application crash.
