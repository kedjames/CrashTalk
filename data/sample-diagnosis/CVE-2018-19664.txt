In djpeg-static, Missing Code to Verify Quantity in Codebase wrbmp.c:145 results in a Inconsistent Value of (184) bytes. Subsequently, the Wrong Index (184) derived was used to perform a Direct Reposition of pointer in Codebase cmyk.h:55, which resulted in an Over Bounds Pointer. Finally, using the Over Bounds Pointer to perform a Direct Read of Moderate data [184] bytes from Heap object of size 183 in Codebase cmyk.h:55 results in a final Buffer Overflow Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to information exposure.
