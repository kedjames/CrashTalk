In w3m, missing code for an initialize pointer operation of pointer (a_select) to valid memory at (file.c:5465) leads to a NULL Pointer. The NULL Pointer (a_select) was dereferenced via a direct Read operation at (file.c:6055), which resulted in a NULL Pointer Dereference Memory Error. If exploited, this can lead to denial of service - application crash.
